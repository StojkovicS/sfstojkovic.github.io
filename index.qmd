Hi, Iâ€™m Stefan. Welcome to my website where you can find my CV, personal projects, and more details about my work and myself.

### Summary

I am a Data Analyst (R \| SQL \| Python) with 4 years of experience in research design, as well as causal and descriptive statistics. Proficient in data analysis, research design, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I currently work (until September 30, 2025) on an international European Research Council-funded project at Witten/Herdecke University. The project is focused on political risk assessment in Europe. My job is to collect, tidy, model and transform complex data into actionable insights. I have a proven track record of enhancing project efficiency and supporting decision-making processes through data-driven consulting.
