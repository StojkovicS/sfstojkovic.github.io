# Freedom vs Security

## Project Overview

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In this project, I explore the delicate balance between freedom and security.\
Using a dataset sourced from various public records and surveys, I analyze how people perceive these two fundamental values.\
My analysis employs statistical methods and visualization techniques in R to uncover key insights and trends.

For more details, you can check out the complete code and dataset on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/freedom_security).
